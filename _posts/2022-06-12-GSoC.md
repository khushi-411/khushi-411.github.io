Heyoo!! I'm happy to share that I was selected for
Google Summer of Code 2022. I'll be working on the
project [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) under the umbrella of
the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) organization.
Wowza, here's my acceptance letter from Google:

<p align="center">

</p>

My project is mentored by [Masayuki Takagi](https://github.com/takagi)
along with the support of the CuPy team!

I aim to introduce the `interpolate` module in CuPy and
enhance the scope of `special` and `stats` modules in CuPy.
If you want to know more about my project, you can
visit the [GSoC Link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/fx6AgHkQ).

This internship is special to me because GSoC was the
first thing I aimed to achieve even before entering college.
I want to complete my task on time, and I'm looking
forward to learning and exploring new things & exciting
experiences along with the guidance of so many talented
people I'll be connecting with throughout the GSoC timeline.

In the upcoming part of this blog post, I'll be sharing about:
1. My Journey & Motivation
2. About the CuPy
3. Community Bonding Period
4. Acknowledgement

### **My Journey & Motivation**

This is the most exciting part of the blog post! :p 

Let's start from the beginning; a few months back,
I was working on a project
[neural-lib](https://github.com/khushi-411/neural-lib),
a simple neural network library coded from scratch and
implemented in PyTorch Python. After preparing a draft,
I requested [Kshitij](https://github.com/kshitij12345)
for his reviews. And I believe that was a turning point.
He said:

> I thought about the project a bit and if you want to give a GPU and Autograd support to your project, then using CuPy makes sense.

I was fascinated to know about CuPy. I did hear about
CuPy during my past internship at Quansight.
And this intensified my curiosity to learn more about it.
I stumbled upon [CuPy's GitHub](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) repository.
I checked various issues and previous PRs.

Woohoo, I was so lucky! I saw [Kenichi](https://github.com/kmaehashi)
created an issue tracker on Implementing all NumPy
APIs in CuPy [#6078](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/issues/6078).
Thanks, Kenichi, the first person from whom I learned to
write tests, about CuPy's codebase, and much more.
I was very much intended to work on it. The next day
I sent my first PR in CuPy, implementing `cupy.asfarray`!

<p align="center">

</p>

It was really interesting PR;
I learned many things, though I believe it is a bit of
embarrassing PR for me right now :o. I continued
contributing to CuPy, working on CuPy's coverage of
NumPy functions. While contributing, I developed a keen
interest in working on project CuPy for this year's GSoC!

The time to start preparing for GSoC!! I stumbled on
the wiki page from CuPy's 2022
[Project ideas](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/wiki/GSoC-2022-Project-Ideas).
Out of the three proposed projects, two of them fascinated me!
The project `CuPy coverage of NumPy/SciPy functions` and
`Enhance CuPy JIT interface` immediately attracted me.

After researching more about the topics, I decided
to go for the first project since I had more ideas
and surety about it. I selected the coverage of SciPy
functions as my GSoC project. You can learn more about
my project in [my proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ckTcAUjuWNfaldpk2Gni6vID4rQlRllh/view?usp=sharing).

After submitting my proposal, I felt relaxed and
confident about my application. Cheers

### **About the CuPy**

Credits official website:

> CuPy is an open-source array library for GPU-accelerated computing with Python. CuPy utilizes CUDA Toolkit libraries including cuBLAS, cuRAND, cuSOLVER, cuSPARSE, cuFFT, cuDNN and NCCL to make full use of the GPU architecture. CuPy speeds up some operations more than 100X.

From the great description above by CuPy Team,
we comprehend CuPy is an edge-cutting technology mainly
used for scientific computing, data science, research,
and many more. It supports CUDA C++ features and presents
highly optimized implementations to the users at more
than 100x speed! Hence, user friendly! I'll be covering more
about the optimization techniques used by CuPy in my
upcoming blog posts. Stay tuned!

### **Community Bonding Period**

First of all, thanks to my mentor, [takagi](https://github.com/takagi),
and the team for your warm welcome and for finding
my proposal relevant to work with you all!

To the audience,
*The community bonding period is the first period of
the GSoC timeline, where mentors and students interact
to discuss their projects and ways they'll
connect in the upcoming month.*

My mentor clearly explained the expectations of three
organizations relating to my project. We discussed that
we'd connect via Gitter chat room and GitHub. P.S.
If you want to join the public cupy community channel,
you can use [this link](https://gitter.im/cupy/community?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link).

We started our project by discussing the order of the
implementation we will follow in the upcoming months.
Initially, we planned to work on BarycentricInterpolator,
special, stats functions, and then one more interpolate function.
But later, we switched to implementing special and stats
functions first, then interpolating the package
according to the user demand. Some of the things we
discussed during these two weeks, in brief, are mentioned below.
I'll divide this into three parts:

1. **Implementing BarycentricInterpolator**:
I always wanted to introduce a module; interpolate is my
first. To the readers of this blog post, this
function constructs a polynomial from the given points
and evaluates it. The numerical stability of this
interpolate function is still a challenging thing
for us! We discussed the places we will need to implement
the algorithm in GPU and identified areas that are okay
with executing it in CPU. This was decided by the number
of points supplied as an input. A lot of things still
need to work on in the upcoming months. Takagi suggested
going through [Berrut and Trefethen's paper](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/publication/PDF/2004_106.pdf).
I thoroughly read that paper.

2. **Implementing logsumexp, softmax, and log_softmax**:
Wow, starting to work on special functions! To begin
discussing, I prepared an introductory slide to
implement these functions. We discussed how we could
optimize our implementation in CuPy. We are implementing
`ReductionKernels` to do so. We discussed how these
relate to `functools.reduce()` in Python. I'll
write another blog post describing more about it.

3. **Implementing log_ndtr**: I created a
`cupy._core.ufunc` to implement `log_ndtr`.
One thing that fascinated me about this is due to higher
numerical precision; we changed the algorithm instead of
just implementing using the formula: `log(ndtr)` as
[SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) did. We (the team and I)
will be discussing the implementation soon.

Thanks, Takagi! This was an awesome experience of the
community bonding period with you and the CuPy team!
So excited to get into it. A lot to learn in the upcoming months <3

Also, please note that this is just the
"Woohoo, GSoC'22 soon!" post where I shared my
exciting experiences. I'll share more about the concepts
I learned in my upcoming posts. Catch you there :)
