Hey there! I’m on the edge of my seat to share my successful
journey over the past thrilling months. Summer 2022 was amazing.
I got an opportunity to work with the CuPy Team (under the NumFOCUS org)
at the Google Summer of Code internship this summer.

## About CuPy

![cupy_logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62256509/189481451-55280225-8950-44c7-aa72-325e4693bb13.png)

Here's the compact description that explains everything about
CuPy. Credits to the official site [cupy.dev](https://cupy.dev/).

> NumPy/SciPy-compatible Array Library for GPU-accelerated
Computing with Python. CuPy speeds up some operations more than 100X.

If you want to know more about CuPy you can check it's
[documentation](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/),
[site](https://cupy.dev/), or CuPy's
[GitHub](https://github.com/cupy/cupy). I wrote an introductory
post about getting into GSoC. Here's the link:
[Woohoo, GSoC'22 soon!](https://khushi-411.github.io/GSoC/).

## My Project

I proposed to work on Project 1: [CuPy coverage of NumPy/SciPy functions](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/wiki/GSoC-2022-Project-Ideas#project-1-cupy-coverage-of-numpyscipy-functions)
under the mentorship of [Masayuki Takagi](https://github.com/takagi).
Here's the related issue: [#6324](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/issues/6324).
of my proposal.

I'm glad I accomplished all the functions I proposed
for the project. I introduced the `interpolate` module and
enhanced the coverage of the `special` and `stats` functions in
CuPy. Gladly, I accomplished other goals apart from the proposed work
(marked with "*") during the GSoC timeline. I have also worked on
experimental kernel fusion methods, Custom Kernels in CuPy
(mainly Reduction Kernel), and universal functions. I documented
my code well and added all the possible test cases. I also created
the performance comparison for all the functions and used NVIDIA Nsight
System for calculating benchmarks in interpolating
functions. Below are the link and a short description of my work.

## Accomplished Work

### Interpolate

Interpolation is finding new data points from the given discrete
set of data points. Interpolation is used in a variety of applications.
It is used in engineering and science to estimate new values from
the given points. The interpolation method can be used where it
isn't easy to use the Gaussian process. Interpolation can also be
applied to higher sampling rates in digital signal processing
techniques. There are many more important applications of
interpolation techniques. These are mainly the following types of
interpolation: Univariate interpolation, Multivariate interpolation,
and Spline Interpolation (1-D Splines, 2-D Splines). To know more
about interpolation, you can check Wikipedia's article on
[interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation).

In my project, I introduced the `interpolate` module in CuPy
and worked on Univariate Interpolation.

Before:
```python
import cupy
from cupyx.scipy import interpolate

# throws error
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name 'interpolate' from 'cupy' (/home/khushi/Documents/cupy/cupy/__init__.py)
```

Now:
```python
import cupy
from cupyx.scipy import interpolate

# works well
```

#### **BarycentricInterpolator & barycentric_interpolate**

Paper: [https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/barycentric.pdf](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/barycentric.pdf)

- [x] Added **`_Interpolator1D`** class: deals with standard features for all interpolation functions (implemented in CPU, due to a smaller number of points). It supports the following methods:
  - [x] *`__call__`*: use to call the next points
  - [x] *`_prepare_x`*: change into a 1-D array
  - [x] *`_finish_y`*: reshape to the original shape
  - [x] *`_reshape_yi`*: reshape the updated yi values to a 1-D array
  - [x] *`_set_yi`*: if y values are not provided, this method is used to create a y-coordinate
  - [x] *`_set_dtype`*: sets the dtype of the newly created yi point
  - [x] *`_evaluate`*: evaluates the polynomial, but for reasons of numerical stability, currently, it is not implemented.
- [x] Added **`BarycentricInterpolator`** class: constructs polynomial. It supports the following methods:
  - [x] *`set_yi`*: update the next y coordinate, implemented in CPU due to smaller number of data points
  - [x] *`add_xi`*: add the next x value to form a polynomial, implemented in CPU due to smaller number as mentioned in the paper
  - [x] *`__call__`*: calls the *_Interpolator1D* class to evaluate all the details of the polynomial at point x
  - [x] *`_evaluate`*: evaluate the polynomial
- [x] Added **`barycentric_interpolate`*** wrapper


#### **KroghInterpolator & krogh_interpolate**

- [x] Added **`_Interpolator1DWithDerivatives`** class: calculates derivatives. Its' parent class is `_Interpolator1D`. It supports the following methods:
  - [x] *`derivatives`*: evaluates many derivatives at point x
  - [x] *`derivative`*: evaluate a derivative at point x
- [x] Added **`KroghInterpolator`** class: constructs polynomial and calculate derivatives. It supports the following methods:
  - [x] *`_evaluate`*: evaluates polynomial
  - [x] *`_evaluate_derivatives`*: evaluates the derivatives of the polynomial
- [x] Added **`krogh_interpolate`*** wrapper

### Special

Special functions are mathematical functions that are known in
mathematical and functional analysis. These are used in various
aspects of geometrical applications and many more. These
functions are used for error analysis problems and solve many
classical problems. Therefore special functions have a high
weightage in terms of importance. To know about special functions,
you can check Wikipedia's article on
[special functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_functions).

In my project, I enhanced the coverage of the following special
functions in CuPy.

- APIs covered:
  - [x] `log_ndtr` [PR #6776](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6776)
    - For more details: https://khushi-411.github.io/GSoC-week1/
  - [x] `log_softmax` [PR #6823](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6823)
  - [x] `logsumexp` [PR #6773](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6773)*
    - [ ] `support multiple output args in reduction kernel` [PR #6813](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6813)*
  - [x] `expn` [PR #6790](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6790)
    - GitHub repository for more details: https://github.com/khushi-411/expn
  - [x] `softmax` [PR #6890](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6890)
- [x] Documentations and tests
- [x] Performance Benchmark

#### **Universal Functions**

- Implemented in `log_ndtr` & `expn` (both numerically stable)
- Wraps into C++ snippet for speedy implementation.

```python
# universal function
log_ndtr = _core.create_ufunc(
    'cupyx_scipy_special_log_ndtr',
    (('f->f', 'out0 = log_ndtrf(in0)'), 'd->d'),
    'out0 = log_ndtr(in0)',
    preamble=log_ndtr_definition, # C++ function call
    doc="""
    ....
    """
)
```

#### **Custom Kernels (ReductionKernel)**

- Similar to `map` & `reduce` operations in python.
- Wraps into C++ snippet for speedy implementation.

```python
# function call
def(...):
    ...
    _log_softmax_kernel(tmp, axis=axis, keepdims=True)
    return ...

# ReductionKernel
_log_softmax_kernel = cp._core.ReductionKernel(
    'T x1',
    'T y',
    'exp(x1)',
    'a + b',
    'y = log(a)',
    '0',
    name='log_softmax'
)
```

#### **Kernel Fusion (Experimental)**

- Compiles into a single kernel instead of a series of kernels
- Experimental implementation to *fuse* `softmax` function
- Drawback here: does not generate competitive codes, therefore,
switched to the normal implementation

```python
def make_expander(shape, axis):
    axis = internal._normalize_axis_indices(axis, len(shape))
    expander = []
    for i, s in enumerate(x.shape):
        if i in axis:
            expander.append(None)
        else:
            expander.append(slice(None))
    return tuple(expander)

@_util.memoize(for_each_device=True)
def _softmax_fuse(shape, axis):
    expander = make_expander(shape, axis)
    @_core.fusion.fuse()
    def softmax_fuse(x):
        x_max = cupy.amax(x, axis=axis)
        exp_x_shifted = cupy.exp(x - x_max[expander])
        return exp_x_shifted / cupy.sum(exp_x_shifted, axis=axis)[expander]
    return softmax_fuse

def softmax(x, axis=None):
    fused_softmax = _softmax_fuse(shape=x.shape, axis=axis)
    return fused_softmax(x)
```
*TODO*: Add `shape` method in cupy.fusion, to use `make_expander` inside fusion kernel

### Stats

Stats is one of the most popular and user-demanding modules in most
libraries. These functions are essential in organizing,
interpreting, and calculating values. Therefore I proposed to
enhance the coverage of the following statistical functions in CuPy.

- [x] `boxcox_llf` [PR #6849](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6849)
- [x] `zmap & zscore` [PR #6855](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6855)
  - [x] Complex number support in `nanvar` and `nanstd` [PR #6869](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6869)*
    - For more details: https://khushi-411.github.io/GSoC-week6/

## My Experience

I love open source. I started contributing to CuPy in late November.
Participating in GSoC helped me continue contributing to the open
source community. I’m glad that the approach to solving
the problem changed after getting involved in GSoC. GSoC helped
me to engage with the CuPy community. It helped me to learn new
techniques and tricks to solve problems.
It’s fascinating to see how CuPy team & GSoC helped to improve myself,
get an opportunity to learn from talented people and be a successful
contributor in the future. I’ve been active in discussion forums,
and various issues and helped newbie contributors review their PR.
I learned how to prioritize my work and connect with people from
different nations, which is my favorite part of participating in GSoC.
