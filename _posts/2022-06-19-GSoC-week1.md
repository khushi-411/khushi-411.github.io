Heya! I'm excited to share my first week's experience
with my mentor, the CuPy, and the GSoC via this blog post.
Are you? It was a great week! Following the discussions
made in the community bonding period, I started working
on a special function, `log_ndtr`. I learned about the
CuPy ufuncs, numerical stability & optimizing the algorithm,
and off-course mathematical details about log_ndtr.
Let's get into the blog post to know more about it :)

Apart from log_ndtr, I worked on adding other
special functions, `expn` PR:
[#6790](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6790) and
`logsumexp` PR: [#6773](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6773)
that I believe are turning into an attractive shape.
I'll share more about them in my upcoming blog post.
This post is for log_ndtr!

I'm planning to structure the post as follows:
1. About log_ndtr
2. Universal Functions
3. Numerical Stability of Algorithm
4. Performance Benchmarks
5. Acknowledgement

Let's dig more ...

### **About log_ndtr**

log_ndtr calculates log of the area under the standard
Gaussian cumulative distribution function.
Mathematically, it is given by:

</p>

log_ndtr returns the area under the graph by
operating the element-by-element in the given
inputs. Such functions are known as universal
functions—more on this in the next section.

Since log_ndtr is a universal function, we
created a cupy.ufuncs to implement it and used
the following algorithm:
```cpp
static __device__ double log_ndtr(double x)
{
    double t = x * NPY_SQRT1_2;
    if (x < -1.0) {
        return log(erfcx(-t) / 2) - t * t;
    } else {
        return log1p(-erfc(t) / 2);
    }
}
```
Same for the single-precision version. I
initially used the templated version, but my
mentor guided me that single-precision versions
are faster on GPU, hence recommended to calculate for both
versions explicitly. And tada performance really
improved a lot. If you want to see that,
please [click this link](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6776#issuecomment-1154865687).

We implemented log_ndtr explicitly for floating-point
numbers and double data type versions. I
also added documentation and test for the same.
Yey completed the PR, and this got merged!
PR: [#6776](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/6776).

Welcome `log_ndtr` to the CuPy! Here's how you can work on it:
```python
>>> import cupy
>>> import cupyx
>>> from cupyx.scipy.special import log_ndtr
>>> x = cupy.array([4, 4, 12, 13])
>>> cupyx.scipy.special.log_ndtr(x)
array([-3.16717434e-05, -3.16717434e-05, -1.77648211e-33, -6.11716440e-39])
>>>
```

### **Universal Functions**
Universal functions, a.k.a ufuncs, work on input
element-by-element patterns. CuPy's ufuncs are
written in Cython. And supports broadcasting,
type-promotion, and output type determinations
similar to NumPy. You can check the official
documentation for the same
[link here](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/ufunc.html).
Ufuncs are called by using `create_ufunc` defined
at [cupy/_core/_kernel.pyx](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/blob/master/cupy/_core/_kernel.pyx).
```cython
cpdef create_ufunc(name, ops, routine=None, preamble='', doc='',
                   default_casting=None, loop_prep='', out_ops=None,
                   cutensor_op=None):
    ops_ = _Ops.from_tuples(ops, routine)
    _out_ops = None if out_ops is None else _Ops.from_tuples(out_ops, routine)
    return ufunc(
        name, ops_.nin, ops_.nout, ops_, preamble,
        loop_prep, doc, default_casting=default_casting, out_ops=_out_ops,
        cutensor_op=cutensor_op)
```
This functions calls the ufunc class
defined [here](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/blob/master/cupy/_core/_kernel.pyx#L1071-L1326).
We created a ufunc for log_ndtr as follows:
```python
log_ndtr = _core.create_ufunc(
    'cupyx_scipy_special_log_ndtr',
    (('f->f', 'out0 = log_ndtrf(in0)'), 'd->d'),
    'out0 = log_ndtr(in0)',
    preamble=log_ndtr_definition,
    doc="""
    ....
    """
)
```
Here, the parameters of the ufuncs are:
- `cupyx_scipy_special_log_ndtr`: name of the function
- `(('f->f', 'out0 = log_ndtrf(in0)'), 'd->d')`: Input dtypes.
It shows the float32 input will return float32
input and we will use the single precision
version for the calculation. Second thing
is it says float64 inputs will output
float64 type and use the default type for its calculation.
- `out0 = log_ndtr(in0)`: It's the default output type.
- `preamble=log_ndtr_definition`: we wrote the
definition of function explicitly in the function.
- `doc`: the documentation part.


### **Numerical Stability of Algorithm**
This is an exciting part of this post.
You might think, as the name suggests,
log_ndtr, we could have implemented as `log(ndtr)`.
Have you thought? I thought so. Let me show you the
pseudo-code of the algorithm using the above method.
```python
if a > 6 do
    return -ndtr(-a)
if a > -20 do
    return log(ndtr)
else do
    calculate Taylor series approximation of erf to compute the log CDF
```

But this process has a major caveat. It
has a high relative error in the interval
[5, 6]. The error value immediately increases and
then immediately falls. You can see the below
visualization to create an image in your mind.

</p>

There's a pretty good solution to this problem
using `erfc` and `erfcx` functions to avoid
loss of precision. SciPy's work inspires this!
Here are the mathematical details about the same:
Some prerequisite formulas apart from
log_ndtr's formula that you should know before-ahead.
<p align="center">
<img src = "/assets/gsoc/pre_formula_log_ndtr.png">
</p>

Let the CDF of the normal distribution be `F(x)`, such that:
```python
F(x) = erfc(-x/√2)/2
     = 1 - erfc(x/√2)/2
```
For values x < -1, to ensure high precision for large negative values `erfc` is replaced in by:
```python
log F(x) = log(erfc(-x/√2)/2)
         = log(erfcx(-x/√2)/2)*exp(-x**2/2))
         = log(erfcx(-x/√2)/2) - x**2/2
```
For x >= -1, formula used is:
```python
log F(x) = log(1 - erfc(x/√2)/2)
         = log1p(-erfc(x/√2)/2)
```
The above formula was beneficial and improved
the stability of the algorithm. Here's
the plot of the stable version:

### **Performance Benchmarks**
The most crucial part! We focussed on the performance
for our impl a lot. In a short summary, we implemented
cupy.ufuncs for performance reasons. Secondly,
and more importantly, we implemented single and
double precision versions separately to get an
advantage of GPU. We achieved approximately 30%
faster speed for float32 than float64. Also, CuPy's
performance compared to SciPy's performance is remarkable! 

Here's the benchmark ...

Please note my system configurations are NVIDIA
GEFORCE GTX 1650Ti (4GB GDDR6 dedicated),
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10870H CPU Model,
and DDR4-2933, 16GB RAM model. You may get
slightly different comparisons in your system.
