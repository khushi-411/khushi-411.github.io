Hi there! I've been diving into the world of parallel programming from
the excellent book "Programming Massively Parallel Processors:
A Hands-on Approach<sup>[1](#link1)</sup>" by [Wen-mei W. Hwu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ohjQPx8AAAAJ&hl=en),
[David B. Kirk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fMbArPwAAAAJ&hl=en),
and [Izzat El Hajj](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_VVw504AAAAJ&hl=en).
The content of this blog post is motivated by the book's first chapter:
Introduction, the second chapter: Heterogeneous data-parallel Computing,
and the Intel blogs<sup>[2](#link2)</sup> on vectorization.

I often see folks working on the speed of execution of programs in 
GPUs and CPUs and reach the conclusion GPUs outperform in many cases.
Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff under the hood.

### **Introduction**
The evolution of microprocessors began in the early 1980s.
Initially, there was rapid growth in performance on increasing the
clock speed. However, after the 2003s, it took a lot of work for
the companies to improve due to heating issues, so the companies came up with
the idea to add more number of processor cores to increase their processing power.
From a single-core processor to a double-core processor, then to a
multicore processor (typically just increasing the number of physical CPUs,
but the operations were performed in sequential steps).
It brought significant changes, but the technique does not actually increases
the speed of execution of the microprocessor; it just adds
another processor core. We know performance is a
never-ending process, and we need technology to produce realistic effects
similar to what we saw in Marvel movies. NVIDIA introduced a new generation
of microprocessors back in the 1990s, which could run software
applications using multiple threads, The threads can cooperate
with each other and run parallelly,
leading to a significant increase in performance for a larger number of
input data. Since then, there have been notable developments in processor speed.
Let's dig in more about parallel computing.

### **Heterogeneous parallel computing**
Following up on the earlier introduction. We saw how the processor
evolved by the time. And the two different designs were introduced,
one by Intel & AMD (latency-oriented design) and the other by
NVIDIA (throughput-oriented design).
1. **Multicore Trajectory**: The team increased the number of processor/ CPU
cores generation after generation to increase the performance.
Since they have multiple cores, they can process multiple instructions
simultaneously, but the new execution of the subsequent instructions
starts after the completion of one instruction. The most recent Intel
processor has a 24-core, which could run 0.33 TFLOPS for
FP64i<sup>[1](#link1)</sup> and 0.66 TFLOPS for FP32<sup>[1](#link1)</sup>.
2. **Many Threaded Trajectory**: In this trajectory, many cores will
perform their operations parallelly, irrespective of the other cores.
The support of the number of
threads that can run in parallel was increased generation after generation.
The most recent NVIDIA arch can run 9.7 TFLOPS for FP64<sup>[1](#link1)</sup>,
156 TFLOPS for FP32<sup>[1](#link1)</sup>,
and 312 TFLOPS for FP16<sup>[1](#link1)</sup> datatypes, which are incredible
results compared to multicore trajectories.

&nbsp;<br>

#### **Why is there such a large peak performance difference between multicore CPU and many-thread GPU?**
The answers lie within the core design structure the companies
selected to follow: the CPUs are designed to optimize the
sequential code, while the GPUs are designed to perform a massive number
of operations simultaneously. Please see the pictures below, which depict
the fundamental architectural difference between the CPU and the GPU.

- The amount of space for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in the CPU is
comparatively very small compared to the GPU. The reason is we
only need to perform sequential operations in CPU, so
Intel dedicated a small amount of space for performing these operations,
while in GPU, we need more space to accommodate as many operations as possible,
so NVIDIA dedicated more space to it; the latest GPUs
(Tesla P100, Tesla V100, A100) support 1024 threads per block
(we'll get into more details about this in later blog posts).
- On the other hand, more data needs to be stored in CPU memory because
they will be waiting for their turn to execute, so Intel dedicated more space for Cache
memory in their processors. In comparison, NVIDIA GPUs don't really require
more space to hold the data, so they dedicated less space for Cache memory.
The NVIDIA GPUs show remarkable performance, but
things are challenging because the speed depends on
how data can be delivered from the host memory to global memory,
then to the shared memory & registers inside the processor block, and vice versa.
We will read more about this topic in my upcoming blog posts.
- Coming back to the point, Intel's goal is to reduce the latency of an
operation so that many operations can be completed in a short time interval,
while NVIDIA's goal is to increase the number of operations performed at a
single instant, aka throughput oriented.

Over time, it was observed that GPUs perform great when we have
to perform many operations simultaneously. But still, under the hood,
GPUs cannot completely replace the use of CPUs; we need to use
host memory for a smaller number of operations.

This led to the introduction of **CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)**.
NVIDIA designed it to support the joint execution of CPU-GPU applications
and for General Purpose Parallel Programming (GPGPU). GPGPUs are used to
perform general mathematical computations on GPUs. NVIDIA added additional
hardware to the chip to run these programs. And the speed of execution
depends on the amount of data that can be parallelized. But keep in note
the most crucial factor in speeding up is how fast you can read and write
the data from memory. Various fusion methods and parallelization techniques
are developed to decrease the gaps between the hardware and software
integration which we'll read later.
Let's hop into some important considerations we need to have if we want to write a CUDA program:
1. identify the part of application programs to be parallelized
2. isolating the data to be used by the parallelized code
3. using an API function to transfer data to the parallel computing device
4. developing parallel part into a kernel function for execution by parallel threads
5. launching a kernel function for the execution of parallel threads
6. eventually, transferring the data back to the host processor with an API function call

### **Let's try some CUDA and Vectorized Code Examples**
Here's an example of vector addition in NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. We created a
function in host memory (`vecAdd`) that asynchronously launches `vecAddKernel`
initiated in the global memory (memory that can be written and read from both
host and device, basically, it's an entry point to every device code).
Kernel functions specify all threads should execute on different parts of data.
It shows a single program is splitting across multiple data in GPUs, aka SPMD.
If you are curious and searching about how to call `__host__`, `__device__`, and `__global__`
functions, check out my [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76863144/14473589).
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// access by both __host__ & __device__ functions
__global__ void vecAddKernel(float* A, float* B, float* C, int n) {
    // local variable `i` & n, generated for each thread in a register 
    // each thread follows the SIMD process
    // threadIdx.x: index of current thread inside a block
    // blockDim.x: number of threads in a block
    // blockIdx.x: index of block inside a grid
    // gridDim.x: number of blocks in a grid
    int i = threadIdx.x + blockDim.x * blockIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {  // memory bound check
        C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
    }
}

// host memory
void vecAdd(float* A_h, float* B_h, float* C_h, int n) {
    // size in bytes
    int size = n * sizeof(float);
    float *A_d, *B_d, *C_d;

    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&stop);

    // allocating memory in GPU, the function accepts a generic pointer
    // returns generic objects
    // adding error checks
    cudaError_t allocErr;
    allocErr = cudaMalloc((void**)&A_d, size);
    if (allocErr != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "A_d: " << cudaGetErrorString(allocErr) << std::endl;
        return;
    }
    allocErr = cudaMalloc((void**)&B_d, size);
    if (allocErr != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "B_d: " << cudaGetErrorString(allocErr) << std::endl;
        cudaFree(A_d);
        return;
    }
    allocErr = cudaMalloc((void**)&C_d, size);
    if (allocErr != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "C_d: " << cudaGetErrorString(allocErr) << std::endl;
        cudaFree(A_d);
        cudaFree(B_d);
        return;
    }

    // to transfer (synchronous) data from host to device
    cudaMemcpy(A_d, A_h, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(B_d, B_h, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    dim3 dimGrid((n + 255) / 256, 1, 1);  // number of threads in each block
    dim3 dimBlock(256, 1, 1);  // number of blocks in a grid

    cudaEventRecord(start);
    vecAddKernel<<<dimGrid, dimBlock>>>(A_d, B_d, C_d, n);
    cudaEventRecord(stop);

    cudaMemcpy(A_h, A_d, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaMemcpy(B_h, B_d, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaMemcpy(C_h, C_d, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // to free storage space of global memory
    cudaFree(A_d);
    cudaFree(B_d);
    cudaFree(C_d);

    cudaEventSynchronize(stop);
    float milliseconds = 0;
    cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop);
    std::cout << milliseconds << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int n = 1000000;
    // dynamically allocate arrays
    // (for larger numbers, normal allocation leads to memory issues)
    float *A_h = new float[n];
    float *B_h = new float[n];
    float *C_h = new float[n];

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A_h[i] = static_cast<float>(i + 1);
        B_h[i] = static_cast<float>(n - i - 1);
    }

    vecAdd(A_h, B_h, C_h, n);

    delete[] A_h;
    delete[] B_h;
    delete[] C_h;

    return 0;
}
```

Let's see a vector addition example in Intel CPUs using vectorization.
Vectorization is a way to write parallel operations in CPUs.
In modern CPUs, these are implemented via Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX);
some of their types are AVX1, AVX2, AVX512, etc. We'll use AVX128 in our example.
In CPUs, each instruction processes multiple data, aka SIMD.
Note that each intrinsic operation is placed in a
register—for more info, check on
Intel's blog on Intrinsics<sup>[2](#link2)</sup>.
In the code below, `_mm_loadu_ps()`, `_mm_add_ps`, and `_mm_store_ps`
are built-in variables for loading the packed single-precision data
from a memory to aligned memory, adding two single precision data
and storing the packed single precision floating point values from a
float32 vector to an aligned memory location.
The compiler can generate optimized results directly from the intrinsic vector.
PS: This information is just a few things I learned by stumbling on the
internet/Intel blogs.
```cpp
#include <benchmark/benchmark.h>
#include <emmintrin.h>  // to include Intel's SSE2 intrinsics
#include <iostream>

void vecAdd(float* A, float* B, float* C, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 4) {
        // _m128: it is a data type with SIMD extensions
        // defined on 16-byte boundaries, similar to int, long dtypes
        // it reverses the order of the arguments by convention
        __m128 v1 = _mm_loadu_ps(&A[i]);
        __m128 v2 = _mm_loadu_ps(&B[i]);

        __m128 r = _mm_add_ps(v1, v2);

        _mm_store_ps(&C[i], r);
    }
}

static void BM_vecAdd(benchmark::State& state) {
    const int n = state.range(0);
    float *A = new float[n];
    float *B = new float[n];
    float *C = new float[n];

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = static_cast<float>(i + 1);
        B[i] = static_cast<float>(n - i - 1);
    }

    for (auto _ : state) {
        vecAdd(A, B, C, n);
    }

    delete[] A;
    delete[] B;
    delete[] C;
}

BENCHMARK(BM_vecAdd)->Arg(1000000);
BENCHMARK_MAIN();
```

### **Performance Benchmarking**
Let's benchmark our code and verify the results with the theoretical
explanations above. Before hopping in, all the performance results
below are taken from NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1650Ti and Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10870H.

I used Google Benchmark<sup>[5](#link5)</sup> to benchmark the CPU's
`vecAdd` function above and CUDA Events<sup>[3](#link3)</sup>
to benchmark the CUDA kernel `vecAddKernel` above. We found
remarkable results, initially for 100 input values; the results shown by
CPU were 776.79 times faster than NVIDIA GPUs. OMG! That's way too huge.
But the exciting thing about increasing the number of particles: NVIDIA
GPUs showed nearly the same performance while the Intel processor got way
too much slower. For 2M input values, GPUs outperform the CPUs by 14.2
times. And this gap will increase with the increasing number of input values.
That said, things are about more than just replacing one another;
it's about utilizing the most adequate thing per the user's requirement.

### **Conclusion**
So, had fun? This blog post was just a gentle introduction to
parallel programming. We started the blog posts with the
evolution of CPUs, which led to the introduction of GPUs. We then
read about how their architectural designs cause such a huge
difference in performance. Later, we ended the blog posts by playing
with some cool examples to write a vector addition kernel in CUDA and
CPU via vectorization and benchmarked them.

I hope you enjoyed it! I would love to know your thoughts and anything
interesting you've learned in your journey to understanding parallel
programming. Feel free to leave a comment below. See you next time in
my upcoming exciting blog post for writing an optimized Matrix
Multiplication kernel! Stay tuned!
